(a) Reason 1: the RLIMIT_FSIZE resource limit is encountered (see setrlimit(2)), or the call was interrupted by a signal handler after having written less than count bytes.
    Reason 2: there is  insufficient  space  on  the underlying  physical  medium

(b) int fd = open(file, O_NONBLOCK | O_RDWR, 0600); When the file is ready, the O_NONBLOCK access mode string will send a SIGIO signal if used when calling open()

(c) The pipe will fail with the EMFILE error meaning the per-process limit on the number of open files has been reached. The EBFILE will be equal to the value of errno.

(d) Wait will return with an error and a value of -1. Errno will be set to ECHILD which means there is no more children the process has to wait on.
