External fragmentation - wasted memory between allocated regions
TLB flush - flushes the TLB whenever there is a context switch.
Dynamic loading - loads parts of the program when they are needed and replaces old subroutines after they run with new subroutines.
Lazy swapper - rather than swapping the entire process into main memory, a lazy swapper never swaps a page into memory unless that page will be needed.
